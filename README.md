# Sentiment Analysis Project

```
$ python3 sentiment.py 
Confusion:

 [ 4293  9707]]

You can provide your own string as an optional argument.

```
$ python3 sentiment.py -h
usage: sentiment.py [-h] [--train TRAIN] [--test TEST] [-m MODEL] [example]

Train Naive Bayes sentiment analyzer

positional arguments:
  example

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --train TRAIN         Path to zip file or directory containing training files.
  --test TEST           Path to zip file or directory containing testing files.
  -m MODEL, --model MODEL
                        Model to use: One of base or custom
```

For example, to test your program on a specific string you can provide it as positional argument, e.g., `python3 sentiment.py "computer science is awesome"`. Use double quotes to ensure that your input string is treated as a single input.

```
$ python3 sentiment.py "computer science is awesome"
[0.23071661 0.76928339]
```

** Note that the skeleton code will read the the zip file directly. You do not need to unzip those files.** 

## Unit testing

To assist you during development, a unit test suite is provided in `sentiment_test.py`. These tests are a subset of the tests run by Gradescope. You can run the tests by executing the `sentiment_test.py` file as a program, e.g. `python3 sentiment_test.py`. 

```
$ python3 sentiment_test.py
```
